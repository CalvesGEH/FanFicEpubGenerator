While it is not against RoyalRoad's terms of service to download content, it must be limited to less requests than a human would be able to do by themselves, therefore I recommend keeping the `MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_REQUESTS_SECONDS` environment variable to at **least** one second.

**I only recommend using this if you are already paying the website of your choice a premium subscription and they allow downloading. I do not condone using this app as your only way of consuming these websites since their content since most of them make their money off of ADs. Please use at your own risk and keep the artists in mind**.
